# Ship early, ship often

Just a placeholder thought. Replace with your own MDX posts.

The key is to build in public and get feedback early. Don't wait for perfection â€“ ship the MVP and iterate based on real user feedback.

## Why this matters

- **Real feedback beats assumptions**: Users will surprise you with how they actually use your product
- **Faster iteration cycles**: Early feedback helps you pivot quickly if needed
- **Building momentum**: Shipping creates accountability and momentum
- **Learning compound interest**: Each iteration teaches you something valuable

## My approach

1. Build the core feature first
2. Get it in front of users ASAP
3. Listen to feedback (but filter wisely)
4. Iterate quickly
5. Repeat

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship it! ðŸš€
